				<h2>MicroCART</h2>
		    <p>MicroCART is a senior design project in which we are to create a modular and easy-to-use quadcopter platform for research and high level classes. 
					The quadcopter is controlled by a ZyboBoard, a development board that features a Zync7000 SoC that combines a dual-core ARM processor and an FPGA. 
					My tasks for this project include researching and purchasing hardware upgrades, the development and testing of a secondary WiFi microcontroller 
					to allow the quadcopter to communicate with the groundstation over WiFi, integrating an optical flow sensor into the quadcopter software, 
					and general software architecture design.

				<h2>Rhopalia</h2>
		    <p>Rhopalia is an open source and cross-platform network-based LED light control system that I'm developing as a personal project. Rhopalia is written in C++ using the 
					boost libraries for C++ to ensure cross-platform support.
					A Rhopalia instance consists of one LightHub, plus one or more LightNode instances. Rhopalia uses the UDP protocol to automatically discover LightNode instances on the 
					network and send color updates. Example LightNode implementations that I've created include LightNode-RPi (LightNode for Raspberry pi, supports up to 5 analog strips, and 
					either one APA102 digital strip or one APA102-based LED Matrix), LightNode-ESP (LightNode for ESP8266, supports one APA102 digital strip), 
					LightNode-Visualizer (renders an LED Matrix on an OpenGL-supported display), and LightNode-Simulator (cross-platform simulator that supports analog, digital, and matrix 
					strips). The Rhopalia system supports different light effects, which are classes that implement the LightEffect interface. Currently, the most noteworthy effects are 
					Sound-reactive effects that create colorful effects for all types effects (shown in video below):

				<h2>Portable Speaker</h2>
		    <p>This speaker is a personal project that is still in development. The speaker consists of one bass driver and two treble drivers in a 2.1 channel configuration.
					I used Sallen-Key lowpass and highpass filters to cross over the audio signal from the bass driver to the trebble drivers, and additional filters to sculpt the bass
					extension. I chose a crossover frequency of approximately 350Hz. This allowed me to perform baffle-step compensation (which occurs at that same frequency) by 
					simply increasing the gain of the bass driver. The speaker box was designed using WinISD, and is ported with a resonant frequency of 58Hz, and the speaker is reasonably 
					flat from 60Hz to 20Khz.

				<h2>Sound Reactive LED Stickman Costume</h2>
		    <p>The Sound Reactive LED Stickman was a halloween costume that I made as a personal project during Fall 2015. The costume consists of over 250 digitally controlled
					RGB LEDs in the shape of a stick figure that are attached to a sweatshirt and sweatpants. The audio subsystem consists of a microphone, preamplifier circuit, 
					and a custom five band spectrum analyzer circuit. The spectrum analyzer uses five 4th-order bandpass filters with peak detectors. An ATMega328p microcontroller 
					connects to the analog and digital subsystem and controls the LED effects.

				<h2>Plasma Speaker</h2>
		    <p>A plasma speaker is a device that uses electrical plasma to generate sound waves in the air. To acheive this effect, the plasma arc is driven by a high frequency 
					square wave that is modulated with the audio frequency signal. While there are many circuit schematics available online to control a plasma speaker, 
					most of them didn't provide a very high quality result. So, I created my own circuit that performs audio input mixing and filtering, creates a PWM signal using a triangle 
					wave generator and comparator, and drives a high power N channel FET with the PWM signal. I found that the sound quality of my circuit was much better than other circuits 
					that I had tried.
